Time invested after project 4 


Item                               Date               time     work done
------------------------------------------------------------------
1 4 kHz Pfeifen
1 Kill motor feep implementation                      3h       reworked timer frequency for motor pwm
1 Test motor freq feep kill                           0.5h     its ok


2 Anfangsstromproblem
2 FPGA: shutdown LEDs              16.07.2025         3h       implemented LED-clearing every ~10ms until 5 posEdge of QSPI-CS are received
2 Testing					       17.7.2025          2h       hardening code after deployment: edge-deadtime, grounding rotor-pcb


3 Optimize Induction
3 Playing with Freq and deadtime   24.07.2025         3h       1.8 A @ 4.8V (500ns deadtime). Somewhat lower than expected...      


4 Increase Brightness
4 Trying Full trotthle after Nr 3  24.07.2025         1h       Works. Seems to be reliable.


5 GUI Motor Control
5 Rework Motor Control GUI         16.07.2025         3h       facelift: slider for set speed, current speed view, emergency btn, emergency ack btn
5 Test Motor Control GUI           17.7.2025          1h       works, sometimes set 0 not seen by webpage
5 Bugfix                           17.7.2025          1h       reset duty cycle fixed


6 Search and destroy PicBug
6 Reassesment                      24.07.2025         1h       Speed dependent (400-600 bad). looks like ESP Problem 
                                                               - when in twitch, resetting FPGA doesnt help, but resetting esp does
															   - uploading picture helps recovering
								   23.08.2025		  3h       Grounded the Rotor PDB well.
								                                - on 500 rpm, no Pictransmissions and twitchg
																- other speeds, no problems seen


7 Conn Quality ESP<->Raspi
7 Looked at RSSI                   24.07.2025         1h       ESP->Raspi -35 dB, PC->Raspi -44 dB, all good.

8 Raspi Os                          ?                 1h       Use of WIFI Dongle. ESP connects seamlessly within seconds now


Setup Rotor PCB Comm 2           15.07.2025         1h       soldered second PCB for communication ESP<->FPGA communication
